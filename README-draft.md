### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

**Equaly space inside a box while keeping elements inside**

**paragraph, headers with no space around**

**Making a button linking to an url**

**Media queries for all type of devices and smartphone**

**Using Gimp to dermine the size of elements**

**Using different fonts to beautify a Website**
I haven't realize until doing this project how fonts are a game changer in web design, and design in general. I am used to write reports, etc. with Time New Roman or equivalent fonts, and using only one font within the document. It makes sens to do this, because using multiple fonts can become a mess quickly and reports are more focus on content rather than form. However, for web design, it can be interesting to use more than one font if choose wisely. Maybe using too many fonts can also be bad, but using only one makes the website less beautiful, *a priori*.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

**Commenting in CSS and HTML**

### Continued development

- would like to use flexbox with more elegance
- would like to train my self to use the other layout method (position: absolute, relative; inline-block, etc.), because sometimes I feel flexbox don't give all the flexibility I want during my designing process
- would like to better myself in structuring html file: no useless "id", "class", "div", better choice in tag. I feel the way I strutured my html isn't the most optimal

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

The resources bellow gave me the necessary knowledge to do this project:

- Google search "comment css": A quick search on Google helped to remember how to comment in CSS.
- [Stackoverflow - CSS media queries: max-width OR max-height](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11404744/css-media-queries-max-width-or-max-height)): This Stackoverflow Q & A helped to figure out how to combine media queries with "OR" conditions using the good syntax.
- [Logic in CSS Media Queries (If / Else / And / Or / Not) ](https://css-tricks.com/logic-in-css-media-queries/): This helped me, in the sense that it confirmed to me that it was possible to make "OR" conditions with media queries.
- [Body height 100% displaying vertical scrollbar](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12989931/body-height-100-displaying-vertical-scrollbar): This Q & A helped to get rid of the scrollbar displayed when body height set to 100%. I discovered the impact of <html> and <body> tags on these issues. 
- [Webfont Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator): This website is very good to generate all formats of webfont to ensure compatibility with browsers.
- [Stackoverflow - Vertically align text next to an image?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/489340/vertically-align-text-next-to-an-image#:~:text=Using%20flex%20property%20in%20css,justify%2Dcontent%3Acenter%3B%20): It helped me to vertically align the "Add to cart" text to the cart logo.
- [letter-spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing): This web page was the reason I succeeded to letter-space the "PERFUME" header.
- [Openclassroms - HTML5/CSS3 course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/1603881-apprenez-a-creer-votre-site-web-avec-html5-et-css3): All the fundamentals of HTML/CSS page building, especially Flexbox, I acquired them from this wonderful website. This course is in French, but others courses are English. I really recommend, well written.
- [CSS Outside Border](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9102900/css-outside-border): This Stackoverflow Q & A helped  me to understand the effect of borders on the box sizes in CSS.
- [CSS padding overrides overflow?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19051411/css-padding-overrides-overflow): This Stackoverflow Q & A was **key** to complete this project. He helped me to tame the flex items inside a box, so it stays inside instead of overflowing, thanks to the CSS code *box-sizing: border-box*.
- [Better way to set distance between flexbox items](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20626685/better-way-to-set-distance-between-flexbox-items): This encourages me to use 'gap' property to put space between flex items.
