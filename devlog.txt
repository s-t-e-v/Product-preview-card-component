Good news: we succeeded to make the button tag behave as previously, with the same previous button design

We are facing several issues:
    - cart icon should be in css instead of html
    - the semantic HTML5 markup need improvments, restructure
    - the footer is overlaps with the main page when the height is too small.
      We need to make this not happen anymore, maybe by making the footer flex responsive, and
      playing with shrink property
